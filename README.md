<h2>✨ About This Repo</h2>

This repository holds the work I completed for my **Advanced Programming Techniques** course.  
It’s basically where I practiced <b>LINQ</b>, <b>Entity Framework Core</b>, and worked with <b>databases in C#</b>.  
Some parts were challenging, but overall it was really fun seeing concepts from lectures come alive in code.

<h2>📂 What’s Inside</h2>

<h3>🔹 Lab 2 – LINQ</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wrote queries in both <b>query syntax</b> and <b>method syntax</b></li>
  <li>Filtered and ordered numbers, then turned them into custom strings</li>
  <li>Selected distinct allergies from a dataset (that was pretty cool 😅)</li>
  <li>Joined people with cities based on population</li>
  <li>Converted lists into <b>XML</b> with <code>XElement</code></li>
</ul>

<br/>

<h3>🔹 Lab 3 – Databases & EF Core</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a <b>SQLite database</b> with <b>Entity Framework Core</b></li>
  <li>Created entities: <code>Student</code>, <code>Class</code>, and <code>Teacher</code></li>
  <li>Practiced relationships:
    <ul>
      <li>One-to-One (Class ↔ Teacher)</li>
      <li>One-to-Many (Teacher ↔ Classes)</li>
      <li>Many-to-Many (Students ↔ Classes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learned how to apply migrations, add/remove data, and print results cleanly</li>
</ul>

<h2>💭 Reflections</h2>

Honestly, these labs taught me a lot:
<ul>
  <li>LINQ changed how I think about working with collections — like writing SQL inside C#.</li>
  <li>Entity Framework Core made me realize how powerful ORMs are for handling relationships.</li>
  <li>I broke my code a lot while testing migrations 😅 but fixing it helped me actually <i>understand</i> what was happening.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">🌟 Final Note</h2>

<p align="center">
This repo isn’t a polished app — it’s more like my coding diary for the course.  
It shows my progress, mistakes, and wins while learning <b>Advanced Programming Techniques</b>.
